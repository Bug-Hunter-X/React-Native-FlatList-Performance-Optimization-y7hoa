This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component and provides an optimized solution.  The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases a FlatList implementation without a proper `keyExtractor` and `getItemLayout`. This results in slow rendering and poor performance, especially with large datasets.  The solution, found in `FlatListSolution.js`, demonstrates the correct implementation of these props, leading to significant performance improvements.
